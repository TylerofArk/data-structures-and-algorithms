# Tree Intersection

* Code Challenge Class 32: Find similar values in two binary trees.
* Author: Tyler Main
* Credits: Luis Rosales

## Challenge

* Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary trees as parameters.
  * Arguments: two binary trees
  * Return: array of repeated words
* Using your Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Approach & Efficiency

* Efficiency
  * Time: O(n)
    * This function will need to traverse both trees regardless of length

  * Space: O(n)
    * This is dependant on the given size of tree1 and tree2
