# Trees

A tree is non-linear and a hierarchical data structure consisting of a collection of nodes such that each node of the tree stores a value and a list of references to other nodes (the “children”). This data structure is a specialized method to organize and store data in the computer to be used more effectively.

## Challenge

### Node

Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

### Create a Binary Search Tree class

This class should be a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:

### Add

Arguments: value

Return: nothing

Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.

### Contains

Argument: value

Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

## Approach & Efficiency

Luis and I hopped on Sunday night to work through it together.

## API

- Can successfully instantiate an empty tree
- Can successfully instantiate a tree with a single root node
- For a Binary Search Tree, can successfully add a left child and right child properly to a node
- Can successfully return a collection from a preorder traversal
- Can successfully return a collection from an inorder traversal
- Can successfully return a collection from a postorder traversal
