# Linked List Implementation

## Challenge 05

Create a Linked List inlcuding a head.

### Features

- Linked List
- Node

## Approach & Efficiency

Big O: O(n)

I followed the demo code. Between that and the reading I think I was able to wrap my head around linked lists fairly well as a start. Worked with Luis and we problem solved together.

# Linked List Implementation

## Challenge 06

Extending an Implementation

### Features

- Linked List
- Node
- Append
- Insert before
- Insert after

## Approach & Efficiency

I used my last code challenge on linked lists to get me started on this challenge. Worked with Luis and we problem solved together.

Big O: O(n)

# k-th value from the end of a linked list.

## Challenge 07

Extending an Implementation

### Features

#### kth from end

- argument: a number, k, as a parameter.
- Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k places from the tail of the linked list.
- You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

# Zip two linked lists

## Challenge 08

Extending an Implementation

### Features

####

- Write a function called zip lists
- Arguments: 2 linked lists
- Return: New Linked List, zipped as noted below
- Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and        return a reference to the the zipped list.
- Try and keep additional space down to O(1)

## Approach & Efficiency

After my initial attempt I found a solution but I couldn't wrap my head around the logic. Later on, Robert and Jun went through a solution step by step at the table I was at and I understood the solution and the logic perfectly for the first time in our linked list challenge week.
